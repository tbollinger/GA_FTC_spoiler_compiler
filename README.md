Grand Archive Spoiler compiler for print and play


# How it works
It doesn't just work. You have to do some stuff manually, but it's what I used to build the grids I uploaded on Discord.

## The python
Mainly beautifulsoup for scraping

## The Bash
This just takes 9 images and makes a grid using imagemagick. You gotta have imagemagick package installed.
`sudo apt install imagemagick` will work on ubuntu based distros.
It's a beautiful program for doing image manipulation from the command line.
